# Governance

## Project structure

Agents UI is currently maintained by the repository owners/maintainers. The project is early-stage and evolves quickly; we value pragmatic changes and clear communication.

## Decision making

- Maintainers make final decisions on roadmap and merges.
- We aim for consensus with contributors when possible.
- Breaking changes should be discussed in an issue before implementation.

## Becoming a maintainer

Maintainers may invite active, trusted contributors who consistently submit high-quality changes and help with triage/reviews.
